This app is peak for turning your favorite pics into ASCII memes. Here's how to get started and flex your creative muscles:

## Running Locally: It's not that deep

To get this app running on your machine, just follow these simple steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Open your terminal in the project directory.
4. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
6. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Drag and Drop: It's giving easy mode

Uploading your image is so easy, it's practically cheating. Just drag and drop your image file anywhere onto the designated area in the app. The app will automatically process it and get it ready for its ASCII glow-up.

## ASCII Characters: They're just internet points, but for art

ASCII art uses different characters to represent shades of gray. Think of it like this: dense characters like `#` or `@` are used for darker areas, while lighter characters like `.` or ` ` are used for brighter areas. The app automatically figures out the best characters to use to make your image look fire in ASCII. The more characters available, the more detailed the output can be, giving your meme that extra *oomph*.
